            Now I would like to know about resources for various management and facility maintenance needs. When I ask about a budget line item, I mean there is a specific amount of money set aside for the service or management activity that I ask about. If funding for the issue comes from miscellaneous or petty cash funds, there is not a budget line item. Will you please provide the information about which of the items I ask about have specific budget line items?
